This a project for my CNIT-381 class.

There are three functions that parse XML, JSON, and YAML and some unit tests using PyTest, There is also the virtual enviroment used to test the code.

for the example files, I used a XML file I modified from Example 1 from https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/iosxr/ncs5000/programmability/77x/b-programmability-cg-ncs5000-77x/m-netconf-session.html and used JSON from this link: https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/json-dummy-data/
I modified the JSON from above to create the YAML file.
